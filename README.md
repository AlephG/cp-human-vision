## Term paper abstract
In this paper, a broadly biologically inspired model of categorical perception in human vision is explored and results from the originators of the model are replicated. Categorical perception is a cognitive phenomenon that occurs as a result of category learning. The model in this paper provides computational evidence that categorical perception may occur at later stages of processing without the need for feedback mechanisms to earlier areas as has previously been suggested. Evidence of the model's limitations through additional simulations is provided showing that the CP effect may not be specific to the later stage of processing but to how and where the signal indicating category membership is provided to the model. Lastly, evidence that the model generalizes well to novel variations of the stimuli is compared to human data.
